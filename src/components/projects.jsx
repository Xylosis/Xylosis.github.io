These bots are deployed using Docker on Google Cloud, and centered around my competitive League of Legends play, and the teams I'm on. They handle keeping track of characters we play, counterpicks to enemy characters, offer team compositions, and keeps track of live games.

Our group implemented Chess, which allowed two players to play verse each other, or one player to verse an AI of their difficulty, powered by Stockfish, as well as multiple other features such as post game analysis (also powered by Stockfish), elo ratings, and timed chess. My role within the group was both the Project Leader, and the primary backend engineer, so I developed the backend for the project, while also assisting and guiding my teammates if they ever got stuck.", skills: "TypeScript, JavaScript, React, Python, Large Codebase Understanding, Debugging, Leadership, Agile Method", image: img5, link:"" },
