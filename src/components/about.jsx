            <h2 className="text">About Me.</h2>
            <p className="text">
                Hello again! My name is Andrew Dickman, and I'm a 22 year old recent graduate from New Jersey Institute of Technology, who graduated in December 2024 with &nbsp;
                <i>magna cum laude</i>&nbsp;honors. I love math and science, so I decided to start off my college career as an electrical engineering student, and studied EE for 
                about two years until I decided it wasn't for me. I still loved the math and science, but realized I much preferred working with software, so at the end of my 
                fourth semester, I switched to Computer Science. This was where I found my love for software development, and software engineering.
                <br /> <br />
                After finally building up the knowledge and confidence I needed, I was able to get an internship in the summer of 2024 at Johnson & Johnson where I worked as
                a Data Scientist, primarily focused on Generative AI development and implementation, within their Technical Research & Development center. This experience
                opened the door to Data Science for me, and showed me how important and diverse of a field it really is.
                <br /> <br />
                Because of my love and interest for software engineering, and my growing interest in Data Science, I'm looking for a role in either field to learn more about 
                them professionally. I believe these roles should go hand in hand though, and a position which utilizes aspects of both would be an amazingly strong and
                interesting position that I hope to work in some day.
                <br /><br />
                Outside of my professional life, I have a couple hobbies I like to enjoy when I have the time to. For example, I love to play card games, such as Magic The 
                Gathering, Blackjack, Poker, as well as some roleplaying games, such as Dungeons & Dragons. I also enjoy playing video games, such as League of Legends, which
                I played competitively for some time, and coding in my free time. When I'm outside, I love to spend time riding my motorcycle, and also playing paintball, 
                hiking, or going on walks with my dog. I've also developed a deep interest in religion and history, specifically ancient religions, such as Ancient Christianity,
                Ancient Judiasm, Zoroastrianism, and the early beginnings of other religions as well. 
                <br /><br />
                CODING AND PROJECTS, BUILDING WEBSITES, SKILLS W TOOLS AND LANGUAGES, DISCORD BOTS & DOCKER, WANTING TO BUILD CHESS ENGINE, ETC.
                Since I am a Computer Science graduate, I think it's important to talk about my experiences coding, as well as projects and other things I've done or have
                interests in.
                <br /><br />
                In addition to everything, I've also begun working with a professor from my college to conduct research within the field of Generative AI. I developed a strong 
                interest in this field from my internship, and researching is helping me to grow that interest even more. To be specific, my primary interest area, as well as 
                my research area, is specifically involved with the latent space for Large Language Models. I'll be looking for ways to try to understand this area better, but
                also the focus will be on visualizing this space to make it easier to understand and interpret.
                
                This research is still in it's infancy stages though, and there's not much to show for it yet, as we just began with this idea.
